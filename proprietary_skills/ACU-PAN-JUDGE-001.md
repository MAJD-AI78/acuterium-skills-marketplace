# LLM Judge — Output Quality Evaluation Engine

## Purpose

The LLM Judge is the quality assurance backbone of the Pan orchestration framework
and the AcuTect-CODEX engine. It evaluates every LLM output across five standardized
criteria before results are accepted into the pipeline.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Threshold |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.25 | Factual correctness, data integrity, citation validity | ≥ 0.85 |
| **Relevance** | 0.20 | Task alignment, scope adherence, query coverage | ≥ 0.80 |
| **Coherence** | 0.20 | Logical flow, consistency, structural quality | ≥ 0.80 |
| **Completeness** | 0.20 | Coverage of required fields, no missing data | ≥ 0.80 |
| **Compliance** | 0.15 | Golden Schema alignment, format adherence | ≥ 0.85 |

## Core Functions

### `evaluate(output_id, llm_name, output, expected)`
Score a single LLM output. Returns an `Evaluation` dataclass with per-criterion
scores, overall weighted score, and generated feedback.

### `compare(output_ids)`
Compare multiple evaluated outputs and return the ID of the highest-scoring one.
Used by Meta Negotiation to select optimal responses in consensus strategies.

### `_generate_feedback(scores)`
Produce human-readable feedback identifying criteria below threshold.
Feeds into the Feedback Loop for corrective action generation.

## Integration Points

- **Pan Pipeline Phase 5 (EVALUATE)**: Called after every task execution
- **Resource Allocator**: Quality scores feed back to adjust model scoring weights
- **Feedback Loop**: Low scores trigger `FeedbackType.QUALITY` entries
- **Compliance Validator**: Scores validated against Golden Schema ranges (0-100)
- **Meta Negotiation**: Used for multi-model consensus resolution

## Golden Schema Alignment

Maps directly to the `scoring` block in the Golden Standard:
```
scoring.reasoning   → Accuracy criterion
scoring.creativity  → Coherence criterion  
scoring.accuracy    → Accuracy + Compliance criteria
scoring.speed       → (tracked separately via PerformanceTracker)
scoring.multimodal  → Relevance criterion for multimodal tasks
scoring.coding      → Accuracy + Completeness for code outputs
```

## Usage Pattern

```python
from orchestrator.llm_judge import LLMJudge

judge = LLMJudge(rules_path="compliance_rules.yaml")
evaluation = judge.evaluate(
    output_id="TASK-001-OUTPUT",
    llm_name="Claude Opus 4.6",
    output=model_response,
    expected=golden_reference
)

if evaluation.overall_score < 0.80:
    # Trigger fallback via Task Recovery
    fallback_model = recovery.attempt_recovery(task_id, error="quality_below_threshold")
```

## QA Guardrail Role

The LLM Judge is the enforcement mechanism for the Critical QA Guardrail.
After each phase in the war game plan, the Judge runs validation:
1. Scores all phase outputs against criteria
2. Checks Golden Schema field coverage
3. Flags any scoring values outside 0-100 range
4. Blocks phase advancement if overall score < 0.80
5. Generates corrective feedback for the Feedback Loop
